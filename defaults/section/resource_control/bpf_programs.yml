# Systemd [Resource Control] Settings
###############################################################################
# Unit resource control configuration.
#
# Configuration options for resource control of spawned processes. Relies on
# Linux Control Groups (cgroups) for organizing processes in a hierarchical
# tree of named groups for the purpose of resource management.
#
# Controllers in the cgroup hierarchy are hierarchical, and resource control is
# realized by distributing resource assignments between siblings in branches
# of the cgroup hierarchy. There is no need to explicitly enable a cgroup
# controller for a unit. systemd will instruct the kernel to enable a
# controller for a given unit when this unit has configuration for a given
# controller (e.g. cpu_weight enables the cpu controller, tasks_max enable the
# PIDS controller).
#
# In addition, various controllers may be also be enabled explicitly via the
# memory_accounting, tasks_accounting, io_accounting settings. Because of how
# the cgroup hierarchy works, controllers will be automatically enabled for all
# parent units and for any sibling units starting with the lowest level at
# which a controller is enabled. Units for which a controller is enabled may be
# subject to resource control even if they don't have any explicit
# configuration.
#
# Options may be added to any systemd units/variables:
# * systemd_service - service
# * systemd_socket - socket
# * systemd_mount - mount
# * systemd_swap - swap
# * systemd.slice - slice
# * systemd.scope - scope
#
# Slice units automatically gain a Requires=, After= dependency.
#
# See reference sections for syntax formats:
# * SIZE (syntax)
# * SPECIFIERS (unit specifiers)

# Absolute path to BPF program (/sys/fs/bpf) to filter ingress traffic.

# Add custom network traffic filters implemented as BPF programs, applying to

# Filters configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by
# processes of this unit. Loaded in addition to filters any of the parent
# slice, units this unit might be a member of, any ip_address_allow, any
