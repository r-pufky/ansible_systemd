# Systemd [Resource Control] Settings
###############################################################################
# Unit resource control configuration.
#
# Configuration options for resource control of spawned processes. Relies on
# Linux Control Groups (cgroups) for organizing processes in a hierarchical
# tree of named groups for the purpose of resource management.
#
# Controllers in the cgroup hierarchy are hierarchical, and resource control is
# realized by distributing resource assignments between siblings in branches
# of the cgroup hierarchy. There is no need to explicitly enable a cgroup
# controller for a unit. systemd will instruct the kernel to enable a
# controller for a given unit when this unit has configuration for a given
# controller (e.g. cpu_weight enables the cpu controller, tasks_max enable the
# PIDS controller).
#
# In addition, various controllers may be also be enabled explicitly via the
# memory_accounting, tasks_accounting, io_accounting settings. Because of how
# the cgroup hierarchy works, controllers will be automatically enabled for all
# parent units and for any sibling units starting with the lowest level at
# which a controller is enabled. Units for which a controller is enabled may be
# subject to resource control even if they don't have any explicit
# configuration.
#
# Options may be added to any systemd units/variables:
# * systemd_service - service
# * systemd_socket - socket
# * systemd_mount - mount
# * systemd_swap - swap
# * systemd.slice - slice
# * systemd.scope - scope
#
# Slice units automatically gain a Requires=, After= dependency.
#
# See reference sections for syntax formats:
# * SIZE (syntax)
# * SPECIFIERS (unit specifiers)

# Process Accounting and Control

# Enable task accounting?
#
# Turning on tasks accounting for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for
# all units contained in the same slice, all parent slices, and units within.
#
# The system default for this setting may be controlled with
# DefaultTasksAccounting.
#
# Values:
#    False: kernel will not track
#     True: kernel will keep track of the total number of tasks in the unit and
#           its children. This number includes both kernel threads and
#           userspace processes, with each thread counted individually.
#   {OMIT}: True (default)
#
# Variable: tasks_accounting | bool
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Max number of tasks that may be created.
#
# Ensures that the number of tasks accounted for the unit stays below a
# specific limit.
#
# The effective configuration is reported as EffectiveTasksMax.
#
# The system default for this setting may be controlled with DefaultTasksMax.
#
# Values:
#       {INT}: number of max tasks
#      {INT}%: percent of tasks relative to max tasks on system (default 4915)
#    infinity: no task limit
#      {OMIT}: infinity (default)
#
# Variable: tasks_max | str
#
# Default: omit (system default).
