# Systemd [Resource Control] Settings
###############################################################################
# Unit resource control configuration.
#
# Configuration options for resource control of spawned processes. Relies on
# Linux Control Groups (cgroups) for organizing processes in a hierarchical
# tree of named groups for the purpose of resource management.
#
# Controllers in the cgroup hierarchy are hierarchical, and resource control is
# realized by distributing resource assignments between siblings in branches
# of the cgroup hierarchy. There is no need to explicitly enable a cgroup
# controller for a unit. systemd will instruct the kernel to enable a
# controller for a given unit when this unit has configuration for a given
# controller (e.g. cpu_weight enables the cpu controller, tasks_max enable the
# PIDS controller).
#
# In addition, various controllers may be also be enabled explicitly via the
# memory_accounting, tasks_accounting, io_accounting settings. Because of how
# the cgroup hierarchy works, controllers will be automatically enabled for all
# parent units and for any sibling units starting with the lowest level at
# which a controller is enabled. Units for which a controller is enabled may be
# subject to resource control even if they don't have any explicit
# configuration.
#
# Options may be added to any systemd units/variables:
# * systemd_service - service
# * systemd_socket - socket
# * systemd_mount - mount
# * systemd_swap - swap
# * systemd.slice - slice
# * systemd.scope - scope
#
# Slice units automatically gain a Requires=, After= dependency.
#
# See reference sections for syntax formats:
# * SIZE (syntax)
# * SPECIFIERS (unit specifiers)

# Network Accounting and Control
###############################################################################
# Enable network traffic accounting.
#
# Accounts for all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets created by unit process, including
# both listening and connection sockets where this applies. For socket
# activated services this configuration setting, accounting data of the
# service unit, and the socket unit are kept and displayed separately. No
# propagation of the setting and the collected statistics is done, in either
# direction. Any traffic sent or received on any of the socket unit's sockets
# is accounted to the socket unit â€” and never to the service unit it might have
# activated, even if the socket is used by it.
#
# The system default for this setting may be controlled with
# DefaultIPAccounting.
#
# Only available for system services.
#
# Values:
#    False: disable ip accounting
#     True: enable ip accounting
#   {OMIT}: False (default)
#
# Variable: ip_accounting | bool
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Implicitly combined with any lists configured for any of the parent slice
# units this unit might be a member of. Both ingress (source IP address
# checked) and egress (destination IP address checked) are filtered by these
# settings.

# * Access granted on match in ip_address_allow
