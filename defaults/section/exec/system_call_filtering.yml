# System Call Filtering
###############################################################################
# Allow specific system calls.
#
# All system calls executed by unit except for listed will result in immediate
# process termination with SIGSYS signal.
#
# Allow system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of operation.
# Recommend allow lists for all long-running system services. Safe basic choice
# for system services system_call_fitler_allow: ['@system-service'],
# system_call_error_number: ['EPERM'].
#
# Uses seccomp filtering to enforce minimal sandboxing environment. execve,
# exit, exit_group, getrlimit, rt_sigreturn, sigreturn, time queries, and
# sleep system calls are implicitly allowed.
#
# Strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths
# of service invocation. execve system call is required for execution of
# service binary â€” if it is blocked service invocation will fail. If execution
# of service binary fails for some reason (e.g. missing service executable),
# error handling logic might require access to additional set of system calls
# in order to process and log this failure correctly. It might be necessary to
# temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of
# such failures.
#
# Recommend disabling alternative service ABIs to prevent circumvention,
# combine with system_call_architectures: native or similar.
#
# Use system_call_error_number to change default action.
#
# Values:
#    {SET}: special case system call set, use systemd-analyze syscall-filter to
#           generate list of current sets.
#   {CALL}: system call to allow
#       '': no system call filtering
#   {OMIT}: '' (default)
#
# system_call_filter_allow: ['@system-service']
#
# Variable: system_call_filter_allow | list of str
#
# Default: omit (system default).
