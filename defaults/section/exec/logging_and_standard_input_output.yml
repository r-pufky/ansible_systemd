# Logging and Standard Input/Output
###############################################################################
# Set standard input (STDIN).
#
# Controls where file descriptor 0 (STDIN) of executed processes is connected.
#
# Values:
#          null: connect to /dev/null (read attempts result in immediate EOF)
#           tty: connect to TTY from tty_path, executed process becomes
#                controlling process of terminal. If already controlled by
#                another process, executed process waits until current
#                controlling process releases terminal.
#     tty-force: tty but instead forcefully and immediately become controlling
#                process of terminal, potentially removing previous controlling
#                processes from terminal.
#      tty-fail: tty but fail if terminal already controlled
#          data: pass data via standard input to executed process. Data
#                configured via standard_input_text, standard_input_data. File
#                descriptor is read-only, returning data followed by EOF.
#   file:{PATH}: connect file system object to standard input. Absolute path to
#                a regular file, FIFO, or special file. If AF_UNIX socket a
#                stream socket is connected to it. Useful to connect standard
#                input of processes to arbitrary system services.
#        socket: connect to socket acquired via socket activation. Valid in
#                socket-activated services only, requires relevant socket unit
#                file to have accept: true, or a single socket. Useful for
#                compatibility with daemons designed for traditional inetd
#                socket activation daemon ($LISTEN_FDS and related environment
#                variables are not passed).
#     fd:{NAME}: connect to a named file descriptor provided by a socket unit.
#                At least one socket unit defining specified name must be
#                provided via sockets option, and file descriptor name may
#                differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If
#                multiple matches, first will be used. If no name is specified,
#                'stdin' is implied ('fd' == 'fd:stdin').

#
# Variable: standard_input | str
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Set standard output (STDOUT).
#
# Controls where file descriptor 1 (STDOUT) of executed processes is connected.
#
# Implicitly gains After= systemd-journald.socket if journal, kmsg,
# journal+console, kmsg+console. Will be an AF_UNIX stream socket instead of
# pipe or FIFO that can be reopened. Executing shell scripts
# 'echo "hello" > /dev/stderr' will not work. Use 'echo "hello" >&2'.
#
# Values:
#          inherit: duplicates file descriptor of standard input
#             null: connect to /dev/null (everything written will be lost)
#              tty: connect to TTY from tty_path, if TTY used for output only,
#                   executed process will not become controlling process of
#                   terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to
#                   release terminal.
#          journal: connects to journal, accessible via journalctl. Everything
#                   written to kmsg implicitly stored in journal.
#             kmsg: connect to kernel log buffer which is accessible via dmesg,
#                   and journal. No different from journal if journal daemon
#                   configured to send all logs to kmsg.
#  journal+console: journal and copy output to system console
#     kmsg+console: kmsg and copy output to system console
#      file:{PATH}: connect file system object to standard output. Absolute
#                   path to a regular file, FIFO, or special file. If file,
#                   opened (or created) for writing at beginning of file,
#                   without truncating; with privileges of user. If standard
#                   input and output are directed to same file, it is opened
#                   only once for reading and writing, and duplicated. Useful
#                   when AF_UNIX socket, as only a single stream connection
#                   created for both.
#    append:{PATH}: file:{PATH} but file opened in append mode
#  truncate:{PATH}: file:{PATH} but truncates file when opened; units with

#           socket: connect to socket acquired via socket activation. Valid in
#                   socket-activated services only, requires relevant socket
