# User/Group Identity
###############################################################################
# Set UNIX user for service.
#
# User must exist before service is started unless dynamic_user enabled. User
# supplementary group list from user default group list; additional groups may
# be configured supplementary_groups.
#
# Warnings are generated when constraints are violated to maintain portability.
#
# Constraints:
# * at least 1 character
# * 31 characters max
# * first character: [a-z,A-Z,_]
# * other characters: [a-z,A-Z,0-9,_,-]
#
# Values:
#    {UID}: user ID
#   {USER}: user name
#   {OMIT}: root if system service, user if user service (default)
#
# Variable: user | str
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Set UNIX group for service.
#
# Warnings are generated when constraints are violated to maintain portability.
#
# Constraints:
# * at least 1 character
# * 31 characters max
# * first character: [a-z,A-Z,_]
# * other characters: [a-z,A-Z,0-9,_,-]
#
# Values:
#     {GID}: group ID
#   {GROUP}: group name
#    {OMIT}: user's default group (default)
#
# Variable: group | str
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Enable dynamic user and group creation for service?
#
# Dynamically create user and group - they will not be added to /etc/passwd or
# /etc/group, but are managed transiently during runtime. nss-systemd
# integrates users/groups into system user and group databases. Allocated from
# the UID/GID range 61184-65519.
#
# Automatically enables:
# * remove_ipc
# * private_tmp
# * no_new_privileges
# * restrict_suid_sgid
# * protect_system: strict
# * protect_home: read-only
#
# If user and group options are omitted, dynamic user/group is implicitly
# derived from the unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix
# qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name
# incorporating a hash of it is used.
#
# Use runtime_directory to assign writable runtime directory to service, owned
# by dynamic user/group and removed automatically when unit terminated.
#
# Use state_directory, cache_directory, logs_directory in order to assign a set
# of writable directories to service that protects from UID reuse
# vulnerabilities.
#
# If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do
# not get access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and
# managed ones. Do not use bind_paths, use caution with AF_UNIX file
# descriptors (not subject to lifecycle and access guarantees of the service).
#
# Incompatible with D-Bus policies.
#
# Values:
#     True: allocate UNIX user and group dynamically when the unit is started,
#           and released as soon as it is stopped.
#    False: do not dynamically allocate user and group
#   {OMIT}: False (default)
#
# Variable: dynamic_user | bool
#
# Default: omit (system default).
#
# Reference:
# * https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/nss-systemd.html

# Sets supplementary UNIX groups for service.
#
# Extended groups in system group database for user.
#
# Values:
#     {GID}: group ID
#   {GROUP}: group name
#    {OMIT}: no supplementary groups (default)
#
# Variable: supplementary_groups | list of str
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Set login environment?
#
# Values:
#     True: set $HOME, $LOGNAME, and $SHELL environment variables
#    False: do not set login environment
#   {OMIT}: True if user, dynamic_user, pam_name set; False otherwise (default)
#
# Variable: set_login_environment | bool
#
# Default: omit (system default).

# Set PAM service name.
#
# A PAM session handler process named (sd-pam) created and is an immediate
# child process of the unit's main process while unit active.
#
# Not recommended with notify_access: all.
#
# Values:
#   {NAME}: PAM service name to use
#       '': no PAM session will be opened
#   {OMIT}: '' (default)
#
# Variable: pam_name | str
#
# Default: omit (system default).
